The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, if you try to perform a calculation that results in a negative value for a property such as `width` or `height`, the browser might ignore it and not render the element correctly.  Another common issue arises when using `calc()` with units. If units are inconsistent (e.g., mixing `px` and `%`), the calculation may fail, or worse, produce unexpected results.
